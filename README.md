Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s busy world. With people constantly short on time and juggling numerous tasks, these systems help streamline decision-making by offering tailored suggestions, thus conserving cognitive resources.

The primary purpose of a recommendation system is to identify content that would interest an individual. To achieve this, it takes into account various factors to create personalized lists of useful and engaging content. These systems, driven by Artificial Intelligence algorithms, analyze all possible options to generate a customized list of items that are both interesting and relevant to each user. This personalization is based on the user's profile, search and browsing history, the behavior of other users with similar traits and demographics, and the likelihood of the user engaging with suggested content. This is accomplished through predictive modeling and heuristics using the available data.
